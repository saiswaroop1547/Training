CSS Animations
---------------
CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript.
The following are CSS Animation properties:
Property		      Description
---------		      -----------
1. @keyframes 		      Specifies the animation code

2. animation 		      A shorthand property for setting all the animation properties

3. animation-delay 	      Specifies a delay for the start of an animation

4. animation-direction 	      Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, 
			      backwards or in alternate cycles

5. animation-duration 	      Specifies how long time an animation should take to complete one cycle

6. animation-fill-mode 	      Specifies a style for the element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both)

7. animation-iteration-count  Specifies the number of times an animation should be played

8. animation-name 	      Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation

9. animation-play-state       Specifies whether the animation is running or paused

10. animation-timing-function Specifies the speed curve of the animation


An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

@KeyFrames example{
	from{background-color:blue};
	to{background-color:red};
}

div{
	width:40px;
	height:90px;
	background-color:blue;
	animation-name:example;
	animaton-duration:3s;
}


We can specify the animation at regular intervals also

@keyframes example {
  0%   {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
  25%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:0px;}
  50%  {background-color:blue; left:200px; top:200px;}
  75%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:200px;}
  100% {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
}

To specify how many times the animation has to run:

animation-iteration-count: n; where n represents number of times to run
animation-iteration-count:infinite; to make it count continous loop


To specify animation-direction:

animation-direction: normal / reverse / alternate / alternate-reverse
normal: As specified
reverse: from last animation to first
alternate: normal + reverse
alternate-reverse : reverse +  normal


animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.

ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
